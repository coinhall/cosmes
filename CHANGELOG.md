# Changelog

## `v0.0.39`

### Features

- Added the optional `height` params to the `FetchClient` to execute queries at a custom block height
- Added batching of queries to `FetchClient` (see `examples/batch-query`)

## `v0.0.38` [breaking change]

### Features

- Added `MnemonicWallet` to allow programmatic signing and broadcasting of txs without relying on a 3rd party wallet/signer (see examples directory)
- Simplified wallet APIs **[breaking change]**
  - `getAccount()`: renamed and reworked to `getAuthInfo()`, but consumers are no longer required to call this method to broadcast transactions
  - `estimateFee()`: second parameter now accepts the `feeMultiplier` directly (still optional) instead of the auth info
  - `broadcastTx()`: second parameter now accepts the `fee` from the result of `estimateFee()` (no longer optional) instead of the auth info
  - `broadcastTxSync()`: new function that executes `estimateFee`, `broadcastTx`, and `pollTx` sequentially
- Handle account sequence mismatch errors directly in `ConnectedWallet.estimateFee()` by retrying once with the correct sequence

### Miscellaneous

- Removed the various `fromXxxToYyy` encoding/decoding functions within `cosmes/codec` in favour of `@scure/base` **[breaking change]**
  - The `@scure/base` pkg is re-exported in `cosmes/codec`
  - Consumers should import the correct encoder or decoder directly from `cosmes/codec`: eg. change `fromHexToUint8Array(...)` to `base16.decode(...)`
- Re-exported `@keplr-wallet/types` from `cosmes/registry`
