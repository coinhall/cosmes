# CosmES

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/cosmes.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cosmes)

A tree-shakeable, framework agnostic, [pure ESM](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c) alternative of [CosmJS](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs) and [Cosmos Kit](https://cosmoskit.com) (**generate bundles up to 10x smaller than Cosmos Kit**).

## Features

> [!WARNING]  
> **This is still a work in progress**. Before `v1` is reached, the API is not guaranteed to be semver compatible - patch releases may break everything. See the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) for notable changes.

- **Fully tree-shakeable**: import and bundle only the modules you need
- **Framework agnostic**: integrate with any web framework (React, Vue, Svelte, Solid, etc.)
- **Lightweight and  minimal**: 153 KB gzipped to connect a React app to Keplr via browser extension or WalletConnect, 10x smaller than Cosmos Kit V2 (see [benchmarks](#benchmarks))
- **Uses modern web APIs**: no dependencies on Node.js and minimal dependencies on third-party libraries where possible
- **Supports modern bundlers**: works with Vite, SWC, Rollup, etc.
- **Fully typed**: written in TypeScript and ships with type definitions

## Installing

For Cosmos SDK v0.47 and below:

```sh
npm install cosmes

pnpm add cosmes

yarn add cosmes
```

For Cosmos SDK v0.50, install using the `sdk50` tag:

```sh
npm install cosmes@sdk50

pnpm add cosmes@sdk50

yarn add cosmes@sdk50
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The bump from v0.47 to v0.50 introduces significant breaking changes and is not recommended to be used unless necessary. To reduce the impact on consumers, the `main` branch and the published package on npm with the `latest` tag will continue to target v0.47 until the majority of live chains have migrated to v0.50.
>
> The [`parallel/sdk50`](https://github.com/coinhall/cosmes/tree/parallel/sdk50) branch targetting v0.50 will be developed and maintained in parallel with the `main` branch, where the same patch version number should have feature parity (eg. `cosmes@0.0.69` should have the same features as `cosmes@0.0.69-sdk50.0`).

### Using with TypeScript

This library only exports ES modules. To ensure imports from this library work correctly, the following configuration is required in `tsconfig.json`:

```ts
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "moduleResolution": "bundler", // recommended if using modern bundlers
    // or "node16" 
    // or "nodenext"
    // but NOT "node"
  }
}
```

### Using with Vite

If you are using Vite, the following configuration is required in `vite.config.ts`:

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  define: {
    global: "window",
  },
});
```

> This can be removed once support for WalletConnect v1 is no longer required.

### Using Station wallet

The Station wallet currently relies on WalletConnect v1. If you want to import and use `StationController`, a polyfill for `Buffer` is required:

```ts
// First, install the buffer package
npm install buffer

// Then, create a new file 'polyfill.ts'
import { Buffer } from "buffer";
(window as any).Buffer = Buffer;

// Finally, import the above file in your entry file
import "./polyfill";
```

See [`examples/solid-vite`](./examples/solid-vite) for a working example.

> This can be removed once support for WalletConnect v1 is no longer required.

### Using Galaxy Station wallet

The Galaxy Station wallet currently relies on WalletConnect v1. If you want to import and use `GalaxyStationController`, a polyfill for `Buffer` is required:

```ts
// First, install the buffer package
npm install buffer

// Then, create a new file 'polyfill.ts'
import { Buffer } from "buffer";
(window as any).Buffer = Buffer;

// Finally, import the above file in your entry file
import "./polyfill";
```

See [`examples/solid-vite`](./examples/solid-vite) for a working example.

> This can be removed once support for WalletConnect v1 is no longer required.

## Examples

Docs do not exist yet - see the [`examples`](./examples) folder for various working examples:

1. [How do I connect to third party wallets via browser extension or WalletConnect? How do I create, sign, and broadcast transactions?](./examples/solid-vite)
2. [How do I programmatically sign and broadcast transactions without relying on a third party wallet?](./examples/mnemonic-wallet)
3. [How do I verify signatures signed using the `signArbitrary` function?](./examples/verify-signatures)
4. [How do I batch queries to the blockchain?](./examples/batch-query)

## Modules

This package is split into multiple subdirectories, with each subdirectory having their own set of functionalities. The root directory does not contain any exports, and all exports are exported from the subdirectories. Thus, imports must be done by referencing the subdirectories (ie. `import { ... } from  "cosmes/client"`).

### `cosmes/client`

This directory contains models and helper functions to interact with Cosmos SDK via the [CometBFT RPC](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.50/core/grpc_rest#cometbft-rpc).

### `cosmes/codec`

This directory contains various encoding and decoding functions that relies solely on [Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API) and has no dependencies on Node.js. For modern browsers and Node v16+, this should work out of the box.

### `cosmes/protobufs`

This directory contains the auto-generated code for various Cosmos SDK based protobufs. See `scripts/gen-protobufs.mjs` for the script that generates the code.

### `cosmes/registry`

This directory contains various APIs, data, and types needed for wallet interactions (ie. Keplr). Some types are auto-generated, see `scripts/gen-registry.mjs` for the script that generates the types.

### `cosmes/wallet`

This directory is a [Cosmos Kit](https://cosmoskit.com) alternative to interact with wallets across all Cosmos SDK based blockchains. See [`examples/solid-vite`](./examples/solid-vite) for a working example.

**Wallets supported**:

- [Station](https://docs.terra.money/learn/station/)
- [Galaxy Station](https://station.hexxagon.io)
- [Keplr](https://www.keplr.app/)
- [Leap](https://www.leapwallet.io/)
- [Cosmostation](https://wallet.cosmostation.io/)
- [OWallet](https://owallet.dev/)
- [Compass](https://compasswallet.io/) (for Sei only)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) (for Injective only)
- [Ninji](https://ninji.xyz/) (for Injective only)

**Features**:

- Supports both browser extension (desktop) and WalletConnect (mobile)
- Unified interface for connecting, signing, broadcasting, and event handling
- Signing of arbitrary messages (for wallets that support it)
- Simultaneous connections to multiple WalletConnect wallets

## Benchmarks

See the [`benchmarks`](./benchmarks) folder, where the bundle size of CosmES is compared against Cosmos Kit. The following are adhered to:

- Apps should only contain the minimal functionality of connecting to Osmosis via Keplr using both the browser extension and WalletConnect wallets
- Apps should be built using React 18 (as Cosmos Kit has a [hard dependency](https://docs.cosmoskit.com/get-started)) and Vite
- Use the total sum of all generated bundles as reported by Vite after running the `vite build` command, including the size of all other dependencies like React/HTML/CSS/etc. (note: this is crude and not 100% accurate, but is the simplest method)
